**Silver C++** is a simple and easy-to-use library designed for text-based game development. You can create an interactive story game, an escape room game, a simple console adventure, and anything!  

<i>When I was a solo game developer, I used to get frustrated with having to adjust every little design detail, like resizing a logo or fixing a missing pixel on my pixel art. That’s when I started exploring text-based games.

I realized that text-based games are often underrated, but they can be incredibly rewarding with a good story and solid game mechanics. That’s why I created this library—to simplify the development process of text-based games.

Creating text-based games is incredibly rewarding, and this library not only enhances their value and productivity but also aims to make text-based games more enjoyed and accessible to many videogame enjoyers. Our goal is to let people enjoy text-based games just as much as they enjoy traditional games.</i>
